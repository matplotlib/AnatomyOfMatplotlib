    "# How to speak \"MPL\"\n",
    "In the previous part, you learned how matplotlib organizes plot-making by figures and axes. We broke down the components of a basic figure and learned how to create them. You also learned how to add one or more axes to a figure, and how to tie them together. You even learned how to change some of the basic appearances of the axes. Finally, we went over some of the many kinds of figures that matplotlib can generate. With all that knowledge, you should be off making great and wonderful figures. Why are you still here?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We don't know how to control our plots and figures!\" says some random voice in the back of the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course! While the previous section may have taught you some of the structure and syntax of matplotlib, it did not describe much of the substance and vocabulary of the library. This section will go over many of the properties that are used throughout the library. Note that while many of the examples in this section may show one way of setting a particular property, that property may be applicible elsewhere in completely different context. This is the \"language\" of matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Colors\n",
    "This is, perhaps, the most important piece of vocabulary in matplotlib. Given that matplotlib is a plotting library, colors are associated with everything that is plotted in your figures. Matplotlib supports a [very robust language](http://matplotlib.org/api/colors_api.html#module-matplotlib.colors) for specifying colors that should be familiar to a wide variety of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Colornames\n",
    "First, colors can be given as strings. For very basic colors, you can even get away with just a single letter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- b: blue\n",
    "- g: green\n",
    "- r: red\n",
    "- c: cyan\n",
    "- m: magenta\n",
    "- y: yellow\n",
    "- k: black\n",
    "- w: white\n",
    "\n",
    "Other colornames that are allowed are the HTML/CSS colornames such as \"burlywood\" and \"chartreuse\" are valid. See the [full list](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colornames.asp) of the 147 colornames. For the British speaking and poor spellers among us (Note, I am not implying that British speakers are poor spellers!), we allow \"grey\" where-ever \"gray\" appears in that list of colornames. All of these colornames are case-insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hex values\n",
    "Colors can also be specified by supplying an HTML/CSS hex string, such as `'#0000FF'` for blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 256 Shades of Gray\n",
    "A gray level can be given instead of a color by passing a string representation of a number between 0 and 1, inclusive. `'0.0'` is black, while `'1.0'` is white. `'0.75'` would be a lighter shade of gray.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RGB[A] tuples\n",
    "You may come upon instances where the previous ways of specifying colors do not work. This can sometimes happen in some of the deeper, stranger levels of the code. When all else fails, the universal language of colors for matplotlib is the RGB[A] tuple. This is the \"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\", and sometimes \"Alpha\" tuple of floats in the range of [0, 1]. One means full saturation of that channel, so a red RGBA tuple would be `(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)`, whereas a partly transparent green RGBA tuple would be `(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.75)`.  The documentation will usually specify whether it accepts RGB or RGBA tuples. Sometimes, a list of tuples would be required for multiple colors, and you can even supply a Nx3 or Nx4 numpy array in such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In functions such as `plot()` and `scatter()`, while it may appear that they can take a color specification, what they really need is a \"format specification\", which includes color as part of the format. Unfortunately, such specifications are string only and so RGB[A] tuples are not supported for such arguments (but you can still pass an RGB[A] tuple for a \"color\" argument).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, oftentimes there is a separate argument for \"alpha\" where-ever you can specify a color. The value for \"alpha\" will usually take precedence over the alpha value in the RGBA tuple. There is no easy way around this problem.\n"

    "# Transforms\n",
    "The topic of transforms in matplotlib, that is the ability to map the coordinates specified by your data to the coordinates of your figure, is very advanced and will not be covered in this tutorial. For those who are interested in learning about them, see the [transformation tutorial](http://matplotlib.org/users/transforms_tutorial.html). For those who are really daring, there are the developer guides to [transforms](http://matplotlib.org/devel/transformations.html) and [scales](http://matplotlib.org/devel/add_new_projection.html). While most users will never, ever need to understand matplotlib transforms to the level described in those links, it is important to be aware of them, and their critical role in figure-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a figure, there are four coordinate systems: *display*, *figure*, *axes*, and *data*. Transforms are used to convert coordinates in one system into another system for various uses. This is how matplotlib knows exactly where to place the ticks and ticklabels, even when you change the axis limits. The ticker says that the tick and label \"1.5\", for example, are to go at data x-coordinate 1.5. The transform says that location is at 0.4 in axes x-coordinate space. Meanwhile, the xlabel of \"Distance\" is placed at axes x-coordinate space of 0.5 (half-way). Meanwhile, a legend might be placed at a location relative to the figure coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the transform system is what is used to allow various scales to work, such as log scales. The transform system is what is used to make the polar plots work seamlessly. Whether you realize it or not, you use the transforms system in matplotlib all the time. Everything drawn in matplotlib has a transform associated with it. Most of the time, you will never notice this, and will happily operate within the *data* coordinate system. But when you want to do some more advanced plots, with some eye-catching visual tricks, the transform system will be there for you."
