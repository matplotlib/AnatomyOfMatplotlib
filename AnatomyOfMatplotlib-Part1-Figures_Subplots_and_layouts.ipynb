      "## Introduction\n",
      "Matplotlib is a library for producing publication-quality figures. mpl (for short) was designed from the bottom-up to serve dual-purposes. First, to allow for interactive, cross-platform control of figures and plots, and second, to make it very easy to produce static raster or vector graphics files without the need for any GUIs. Furthermore, mpl -- much like Python itself -- gives the developer complete control over the appearance of their plots, while still being very usable through a powerful defaults system.\n",

      "## Online Documentation\n",
      "The [matplotlib.org](http://matplotlib.org) project website is the primary online resource for the library's documentation. It contains [examples](http://matplotlib.org/examples/index.html), [FAQs](http://matplotlib.org/faq/index.html), [API documentation](http://matplotlib.org/api/index.html), and, most importantly, the [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Gallery\n",
      "Many users of matplotlib are often faced with the question, \"I want to make a plot that has X with Y in the same figure, but it needs to look like Z\". Good luck getting an answer from a web search with that query. This is why the [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) is so useful, because it showcases the variety of ways one can make plots. Browse through the gallery, click on any figure that has pieces of what you want to see the code that generated it. Soon enough, you will be like a chef, mixing and matching components to produce your masterpiece!\n",
      "\n",
      "As always, if you have a new and interesting plot that demonstrates a feature of matplotlib, feel free to submit a well-commented version of the example code for inclusion.\n",

      "## Mailing Lists and StackOverflow\n",
      "When you are just simply stuck, and can not figure out how to get something to work, or just need some hints on how to get started, you will find much of the community at the matplotlib-users [mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=80706). This mailing list is an excellent resource of information with many friendly members who just love to help out newcomers. The number one rule to remember with this list is to be persistant. While many questions do get answered fairly quickly, some do fall through the cracks, or the one person who knows the answer isn't available. Therefore, try again with your questions rephrased, or with a plot showing your attempts so far. We love plots, so an image showing what is wrong often gets the quickest responses.\n",
